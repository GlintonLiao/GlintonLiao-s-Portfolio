    <h2>Background: Urban Renewal</h2>
    
    <p>Based on the current situation of the site and existing problems, in response to the background of urban renewal, this project considered the development of time and the needs of the future, along with the adaptability in the city context, tapped the module's self-renewal potential and functional expansion potential.</p>

    <h3>Site Analysis: Nanting Village</h3>

    <div class="caption">
        <p class="caption" style="font-size: 1rem;">Site Location</p>
    </div>

    <p>The site is located in Nanting Village, University City, Panyu District, Guangzhou, Guangdong, adjacent to Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou University and Guangzhou Academy of Fine Arts. Nanting Village is a combination of typical urban villages and surrounding communities. It is an essential place for college students, former villagers, and nearby stall vendors to have a multi-subject production and life. We try to activate community spaces through planning and design, create a platform that is conducive to communication and creativity, and ultimately achieve continuous integration of communities and universities.</p>

    <h3>Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Center</h3>

    <p>Now the layout of the university town is a ring structure. The outermost part is the teaching facilities of various universities. The middle section is the dormitory area and some large shopping malls. The core part is low-density public facilities such as parks, sports facilities, and public libraries.</p>

    </div>

    <blockquote>"But our beautiful ideal has been cut off by the wall in our restrictions." Professor Yuan said, "The students can be together, taking part in various community activities, and should be horizontally connected. Now the interaction between the dormitory area and the teaching area has become a vertical relationship of administration, which is a kind of hierarchy."</blockquote>

    <h3>Concept</h3>
   
    <h2>Break the wall</h2>

    <p>Now the layout of the university town is a ring structure. The outermost part is the teaching facilities of various universities. The middle section is the dormitory area and some large shopping malls. The core part is low-density public facilities such as parks, sports facilities, and public libraries. The core concept of its design at the time was resource sharing and space openness.</p>

    <p>As a necessary supporting facility for the university city, Urban Village provides housing, living convenience services, gourmet snacks, and revolving housing for college students, school staff, sanitation workers, shop clerks, couriers, etc.</p>

    <blockquote>How to break this "wall" and serve the surrounding residents and college students to form a shared and vibrant community space ?</blockquote>

    <h2>Computational Module Design</h2>

    <p>Two basic units, which can be spliced together, can get a variety of furniture such as stairs, floors, tables and chairs, lockers, booths, and so on.</p>

    <p>The basic unit 1 is used as a horizontal unit, and the basic unit 2 is used as a vertical unit, and a rich spatial variation conforming to the human body scale is obtained by up-and-down displacement.</p>

    <h3>Parametric Aided Design</h3>

    <p>According to the four height variations, all 64 variation values of the No. 1 section line were calculated, and the repeated variation values were selected to obtain 32 non-repetitive variations.</p>

    <div class="caption">
      <p class="caption" style="font-size: 1rem;">First Step</p>
    </div>

    <p>According to the four height variations, all 64 variation values of the section line of the No. 2 plate were calculated, and 32 repeated variation values were selected, and 32 non-repetitive variations were finally obtained.</p>

    <div class="caption">
      <p class="caption" style="font-size: 1rem;">Second Step</p>
    </div>

    <p>Set the value of the section line of the No. 3 plate, and arrange the three sections of the section line to obtain 1024 variations.</p>

    <div class="caption">
      <p class="caption" style="font-size: 1rem;">Third Step</p>
    </div>

    <p>The 1024 kinds of variation values produced by the combination of the three panel section lines produce 1024 kinds of floor forms through a series of offset facets and extrusions, and the steel support structure of the bottom plate is generated through the section line, and finally 1024 kinds of non-repetitive bottom plates are obtained.</p>

    <p>This is only a small fraction of the 1,024 results, and all results were generated by a computer in 48 seconds.</p>

    <h2>The advantage of module: free custom</h2>

    <h3>Urban Renewal: Module growth over time</h3>

    <p>The point module can be developed into a line according to the situation of the residents and tends to be stable after some time.</p>

    <div class="caption">
      <p class="caption" style="font-size: 1rem;">Dot Modular Growth</p>
    </div>

    <p>The linear module develops into a surface shape according to the change of the booth personnel and tends to be stable after a while.</p>

    <div class="caption">
      <p class="caption" style="font-size: 1rem;">Linear Module Growth</p>
    </div>

    <p>The surface modules are placed in a new function block due to the increase in social functions, and the old function block is dying and is dynamically changing.</p>

    <h3>Free Custom App</h3>

    <p>People can use mobile application to reserve and construct module.</p>

    </div>

    <h3>Detachable Module</h3>

    <p>None of the nodes is strictly fixed. These detachable nodes facilitate the growth of the building. No professional workers are required to modify the modules.</p>

    <h3>Street Adaptability</h3>

    <p>Some of the modules are empty, allowing trees and power poles to pass through them.</p>

    <h3>Module Distribution</h3>

    <p>The modular design enables the building to fully integrate with the complex context of the village in the city, where the points, lines, and planes can grow freely and serve different functions.</p>
