    <h3>Archimason is a desktop online project management platform that improves the efficiency of design with task tracking options.</h3>

    <p>The goal of Archimason is to support and empower designers on their journey towards a work-life balance lifestyle. the app features <strong>files sharing, live meetings, and task managing to enhance the online connection.</strong> Archimason empowers users by introducing an easy way of collaborating closely in a complex project. </p>

    <h3>Problem space</h3>

    <h2>A senior architect in the office fell in a faint one day before submitting the bidding document.</h2>

    <blockquote>
      <p>85% of the architects work for over <strong>80 hours a week</strong> and 100 hours a week before the deadline.</p>
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>Ji Cheng, a famous Chinese WeChat official account features on the news in architecture.</p>


    <p>There is no official "project manager" title in an architecture firm, everybody is an "architect", and some of them are in charge of project management depends on needs. Above was a true story, happening right around me. Overworking has been a "standard phenomenon" in the architects' world. Everybody in the office staring at the computer screen, without realizing there is something wrong with the body. The architect I mentioned before was diagnosed with myocardial strain. And Finally, yes, the bomb blew up.</p>

    <h3>Approach</h3>

    <h2>What are the reasons that hinder designers from finishing the tasks on time?</h2>

    <p>To start off our research, I conducted preliminary 1:1 user interviews with both groups of architectural designers and “project managers”. Through the process, I identified a significant difference in the design process of designers vs. project managers. From the journey map, I highlighted three key pain points that drag on overall efficiency.</p>

    <blockquote>"Design is an infinite process, there is no such 'perfect' design, we need to polish till the last second."</blockquote>

    <h3>Discovery</h3>
   
    <h2>The deadline is not the deadline.</h2>

    <p>Based on the interview findings, I identified the users struggled to finish the task on time due to the <strong>poor task management, the pressure brought by multithreaded work, and lack of time awareness.</strong></p>

    <h3>Goal</h3>

    <h2>How might we help the architects to manage the tasks based on their circumstances, the number and character of tasks, and the specific design timeline?</h2>

    <p>I came up with a hypothesis that with <strong>the more clear task sheet and time tracking, the more punctual architects will feel to finish the tasks.</strong> Then, I sorted out a <strong>flow model with hierarchy</strong>, to show how we can engage the architects to better achieve the goal.</p>

    <h3>Explorations</h3>

    <h2>I set off to create a desktop design assistant with three core features.</h2>

    <p>With this goal in mind, I moved on to brainstorm for features for the app with consideration for the user persona and pain points. After exploring a range of ideas through creating wireframes and user journeys I decided to create a <strong>desktop design management tool.</strong> I felt that a desktop application would be a specific, all-in-one medium that would allow architects to go through their design process in an informative and effortless way.</p>

    <h3>During the process, I established a scalable design system for Archimason</h3>

    <p>For any further exploration of the app, I delivered a <strong>design system</strong> to ease the implementation process. The design system features a typography and color system and a component library. The typography system is built on the Cabin family, a Humanist font is known for its sense of personal touch on whimsical curvatures, and the color system is centered on the primary green palette to <strong>convey the concept of high efficiency working.</strong></p>

    <h3>Final Outcome</h3>

    <p>As a result of the project, I delivered an Archimason desktop app. By <strong>combining the core design task sheet with the timeline</strong> I aimed to help designers to actively engage with the team across every stage of design. The task sheet and time management would act as the centerpiece of the app, and <strong>the review system and file sharing</strong> feature would provide the designers with capacity to continue pursuing a high-efficiency working habit.</p>

    <h2>Dashboard and project tasks overview</h2>

    <p>The dashboard features project information such as <strong>deadline, list of drawing and team members.</strong></p>

    <h2>Split the tasks, arrange time intuitively</h2>

    <p>Keep track of every single task easily, and <strong>arrange tasks livelily and visually</strong>. The system will automatically remind the important time node.</p>

    <h2>Automatically Intelligent estimate of completion time</h2>

    <p>Users can select different elements and features of the task, the system will <strong>calculate time based on the information.</strong></p>

    <h2>Real-time review and synchronization</h2>

    <p>Set time to review the outcome of the team, make it clear when the task is finished.</p>

    <h2>Impact</h2>

    <p>The app received positive feedback from the user groups made of both designers and project managers. Our company decided to change the pattern of project management from oral to using tools. Although right now we still don't have a holistic platform, the awareness of project management has been raised. <strong>After rough estimation, the tool can at least save 20 hours in a single architectural design process.</strong></p>
