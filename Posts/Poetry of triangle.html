    <h2>The triangle, something architects pray for not to encounter</h2>
    
    <p>Triangles, as one of the basic geometries, possess many properties. A triangle, for example, is <strong>the smallest shape needed to determine a plane.</strong> The three sides of a triangle support each other to provide a strong character, which makes the triangle a common structural element in architecture.</p>

    <h3>Triangle in Architecture</h3>

    <p>Triangles, as one of the basic geometries, possess many properties. A triangle, for example, is the smallest shape needed to determine a plane. The three sides of a triangle support each other to provide a strong character, which makes the triangle a common structural element in architecture.</p>

    <p>But <strong>what if triangles have another potential in space? What if we could use triangles to create spaces that no other geometric element could? What has other relationships between triangles and the human body not been explored?</strong> We can reduce such questions into one question:</p>

    <blockquote>Can a triangle jump out of the inherent cognition of the original "structure" and create a dynamic and diverse architectural space?</blockquote>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <h3>Concept</h3>
   
    <h2>Triangle as basic geometry</h2>

    <p>This design proposal uses a triangle as the basic geometric motif in an attempt to answer the above questions. The triangular site has given rise to the question of triangles, which have long been a problem that architects have been reluctant to face. At the same time, new types of space redefine the relationship between daily life and contemporary art.</p>

    <h3>Combine art and architecture</h3>

    <p>The triangle in the architecture vividly shows the character of the artist, and the dilemma of the artist's life is solved in a very creative way. At the beginning of an artist's career, there is not enough money to support his/her studio, and his/her works have no popularity. <strong>Combing the contemporary art museum and the studio and the living space for young artists will be the right solution because they can use the museum itself to create innovative objects without concerning if they can afford the house rent.</strong> What they created <strong>can even be sold along with the exhibition.</strong> The museum contains four floors, and space is organized from the public to private, from integration to separation, to reconstruct artists' life by using the triangle.</p>

    <h3>Potential of Triangular Space</h3>

    <p>Started from the way of subdivision of the triangle, the possibility of the triangle in spatial typologies are explored through the superposition, twist, and combination of different types of triangles.</p>

    <h2>Form Generation</h2>

    <p>From 2D to 3D, all is about triangle.</p>

    <h2>Turning things usable and interesting
    </h2>

    <p>This part contains detail thought and focus.</p>

    <h3>First Floor: Order and Disorder</h3>

    <p>The three sides of the triangle form the first grid, which serves as a reference for the position of the outer column; the center point of the geometry forms the second grid, which provides the location of the scattered thin columns. In terms of the edges and corners, <strong>the pillars have been twisted, which caused a subtle dislocation with the adjacent pillars while maintaining the overall parallel relationship.</strong></p>

    </div>

    <h3>Second Floor: Connection and Separation</h3>

    <p><strong>The triangular layout not only integrates the exhibition and the architecture itself but also naturally forms an excellent flow of the exhibition.</strong> When the last exhibit has not disappeared from sight, the next one will come into view, which is a seamless exhibition viewing experience. There is a space slot between the three art studios and the exhibition viewing area, making the artist's creation process within sight but out of reach.</p>

    </div>

    <h3>Third Floor: Horizontal and Inclination
    </h3>

    <p>The third floor serves as a shared space for artists, <strong>with no physical walls and instead of a horizontal or sloping floor.</strong> People can have unlimited social activities on the slope in different body positions. The steps above the art studio <strong>can even be used as an auditorium </strong>when holding events here.</p>

    </div>

    <h3>Fourth Floor: Centralization and Decentralization</h3>

    <p>The fourth floor houses the artists' apartments, so the vertical traffic is separated from the previous system. The floor plan looks like a random collection of rectangular rooms, but <strong>it's actually a cross-shaped central space and a collection of scattered triangle roofs.</strong> A less obvious axis separates the triangle plan, and due to the triangular roof, a series of integrated and separated poche is formed on the plan.</p>

    <h3>Art Studio: Art and People</h3>

    <h3>A system, not merely a "landscape"</h3>

    <div class="caption">
      <p class="caption" style="font-size: 1rem;">Model</p>
    </div>

    <p>The art studio is like an upside-down triangular house suspended in the gap between the second and third floors. It not only serves as a transition between the second and third floors in spatial form but also defines a new way of viewing exhibitions: <strong>people can experience the production process of the exhibits while enjoying them.</strong></p>

    <h3>Visible and Invisible Triangle</h3>

    </div>

    <p>When people get close to the building and look at it from a certain Angle, they experience a unique <strong>sense of visual illusion.</strong> The pillars on the first floor and the structure of the third floor together form a complete triangle. Due to the influence of <strong>gestalt psychology,</strong> people will automatically complete the triangle even if the second floor is empty. The structure of the entity implies the space of the virtual body, but when people come closer to the building, the relationship doesn't exist anymore.</p>

    <h3>Triangular Forest</h3>

    <p>The scattered thin pillars and triangular bifurcated beams look like a forest.</p>

    </div>

    <h3>Structure Deception</h3>

    <p>The beam on the ground floor penetrates through the seemingly solid pillars to form a node, hinting at the actual load-bearing structure. The way of connecting the beams of each layer is different, which makes people question the whole structure.</p>

    <h3>Contemporary Art Museum in a Historical Street Area</h3>

    <p>The orientation of the whole building is different from the urban grid, but the size of a single unit is similar to the surrounding traditional houses. The triangular apartments facing the two sides of the regular urban context are cut into different sizes by the site; <strong>On the side facing the natural environment, the units stay intact.</strong></p>
