    <h2>Problem space</h2>
    
    <p>Guangzhou is one of the cities with the earliest urbanization in China. At present, there are 1.87 million small and medium-sized cars in Guangzhou. However, Guangzhou has only 660000 parking lots), <strong>Many car owners complain about the difficulty of parking.</strong> Parking has become one of the biggest problems of a metropolis.  Buying a car is not only a hindrance to the city, but also to oneself.</p>
    </p>


    <p>Compared with car washing, car repair, and other services, <strong>parking is the high-frequency demand of car owners, which is the essential need of car owners.</strong> And there is an interesting phenomenon in Guangzhou: </p>

    <blockquote>A parking space is hard to find in the downtown area during the day, but in the meantime, many parking spaces in residential communities sit idle.</blockquote>

    <p>In urban planning, this phenomenon is known as the "pendulum phenomenon", which means that the population of a city <strong>moves back and forth like a pendulum at a fixed time and place every day.</strong> According to relevant surveys, private car parking in residential areas is <strong>idle for an average of 14 hours every day, which has huge potential for sharing.</strong></p>

    <h3>How might we</h3>

    <blockquote>Create a parking sharing platform to make the idle parking spaces in residential areas used in the daytime to alleviate the parking difficulties and realize the reasonable allocation of parking resources.</blockquote>

    <h3>Compatitive Analysis</h3>

    <p>At the beginning of the research, we analyzed the existing parking software in the market, find out the pros and cons of them, and what we can learn from them.</p>
    
    <img src="/img/Pendulum Parking/Competitive_Analysis.png" alt="image" >
   
    <h2>User & Field Research</h2>

    <p>At the same time, in order to better understand users' pain points and find potential ways to improve the current parking difficulties, we selected a residential area (Yuexiu Vanke Golden Homeland, Guangzhou) for a field survey and questionnaire interviews.</p>

    <p>After the research, we made a quick review and a <strong>requirement pool</strong> of the sharing parking product, which can be divided into two main goals: a comprehensive parking system, and a safe and convenient parking space management platform.</p>

    <h2>Design</h2>

    <h3>Concept Sketch</h3>

    <p>At the beginning of the design, I created some <strong>user story sketches to help to understand the scenario </strong>and start to prototype by designing several key pages.</p>

    <div class="div-block-2imgs">

      <div>
        <h3>Home Page</h3>
        <p>The two main functions (parking space management and parking space rental) are juxtaposed to enable users to quickly understand the main functions of the APP. At the same time <strong>exposed common address, reduce user operation process, improve efficiency.</strong></p>

        <h3>Search Result</h3>
        <p>According to the content of user interviews, I took <strong>price and distance as the main factors to screen</strong>, and visually reflected the price range through visual means；Add evaluation tags to help users make decisions</p>
      </div>

    </div>

    <div class="div-block-2imgs">

      <div>
        <p>Click to expand the drop-down list, exposing the evaluation, distance, cut-off sharing time and other information of each parking space. <strong>According to Sigg's law, the drop-down list only shows the three parking Spaces that best meet the user's needs</strong>, making it easy for the user to make a choice.</p>

        <h3>Booking Space</h3>
        <p>Provide a top view of the parking lot to help users understand the location of parking Spaces and make decisions faster;
        TAB bar is added below the navigation bar to switch the current area and reduce the user's information burden. <strong>Meanwhile, according to Miller's Law, the number of displayed tags is set to 6.</strong></p>

        <h3>Billing Page</h3>
        <p>According to the user interview and the user journey map, the user pays attention to the parking time and parking fee. Click the price to view the composition details. At the same time, indoor navigation can be turned on to help find parking Spaces.</p>
      </div>

    </div>

    <h3>Space Manegement</h3>

    <p>Users can manage the sharing time of parking Spaces as intuitively as setting an alarm clock. <strong>If the sharing ends ahead of schedule, the benefits of this sharing will not be obtained.</strong> The person renting the parking Spaces will also be free of charge. If you need someone to move the car, you can call.</p>

    <h3>Side Bar and Income Page</h3>

    <p>The structure of the whole app is connected in series by the side navigation bar, thus we can enter the income detail page.</p>

    <p>The color of the card changes according to the shared time, white by day, black by night, auxiliary parking space master discrimination management; The trend curve of income also can reflect intuitively, strengthen the sense of achievement of users.</p>

    <h2>Impact and takeaway</h2>

    <p>Sharing Economy is a hot topic nowadays, and we took it as the model to make this project, which actively responds to the parking difficulties in big cities and realizes the reasonable allocation of parking space resources, which has certain enlightenment significance for the construction of smart cities.</p>

    <p>Next, I may introduce intelligent hardware, such as parking floor lock, to realize the intelligent management of parking Spaces. Floor locks turn on automatically when they come, pay automatically when they leave, and so on. This is also the future convenient life envisioned by "Calm technology" and the Internet of Things.</p>
